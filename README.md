# FILE ORGANISER

## Core idea
- User is prompted to specify source and target directories
- Using a rule file, allows to specify action for certain files based on an attribute (file extension in this case)
- Once executed, files from source will be moved to and organised at the target directory

## FILE ACTIONS
- **MOVE** -> Moves files from source to target.
- **COPY** -> Copies files from source to target.
- **DELETE** -> Deletes files from source.
